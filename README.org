* About
Monolopy is a popular game among the world. And my teacher required me to use the design pattern to reproduce that game. So this is a repo about this game.

My teacher also offered his implementation of this game. His source code is listed in folder =Teacher=.

* Invovled Design Patterns
- 01Monopoly: Multition Pattern, Singleton Pattern, Factory Pattern, Abstract Factory Pattern, Generator Pattern, Prototype method
- 03Monopoly: Bridge Pattern, Adapter Pattern
- 04Monopoly: Decorating Pattern, Proxy Pattern
- 05Monopoly: Iterator Pattern, Strategy Pattern, Command Pattern, State Pattern, Visitor Pattern

* Screentshot
Here lists some screentshots of my implementation:

One of the map is what below picture shows and the player is shown by his ID like 0, 1, 2. The human player is surrounded by symbol []; the computer player is surrounded by symbol ().

The Info of the player is like this:

* How to run my Java code
You need to open terminal in that folder at the very beginning.

** 01Monopoly
The files under that folder satisfy the requirements of problem =1, 2, 3, 5=, you do can run these java files.

Folders =Q12356a= , =Q12356bcd= , =Q12356ef= mean it further implements the requirement =a= of problem 6 or requirements =bcd= of problem 6, etc. They are complete code not like folder =Q6a_fm_Block= etc.

Make sure you create the =bin= folder manually.
#+BEGIN_SRC bash
$ javac -d ./bin GameTestDrive.java
$ java  -cp ./bin GameTestDrive
#+END_SRC

If you don't want to create that folder, run command below:
#+BEGIN_SRC bash
$ javac GameTestDrive.java
$ java  GameTestDrive
#+END_SRC

** 03Monopoly
Same as =01Monopoly=

** 04Monopoly
Make sure open terminal in =src= folder.

Run command below
#+BEGIN_SRC bash
$ javac -d ..\bin .\game\GameTestDrive.java
$ java -cp ..\bin game.GameTestDrive 
#+END_SRC

** 05Monopoly
Same as =03Monopoly=, maybe you need =JNative.jar= ? I forget.

* Further Working
- [ ] Add building to the game
- [ ] Think of an easier way to add new kind of player except using Visitor Pattern
- [ ] Add level property to the player
- [ ] Add accident to the game
